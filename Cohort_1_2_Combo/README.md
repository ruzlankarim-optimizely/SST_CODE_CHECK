# COHORT 2
This has code that combines list of customers in Cohort 1 & 2
Cohort 1 -- customers who transition from TAT to UFDM 
Cohort 2 -- customers who churned out from TAT and may appear in UFDM again
These 2 cohorts are supposed to be independent. However, due to mistakes in sensitivity analysis, they might not be.
